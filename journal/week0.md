# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## This week at Cloud Project Bootcamp:

1. The first thing I did was set up all the environments to help me complete my task. These include:
    - Create a Gitpod account and install the Gitpod Chrome extension.
    - Tightening my already existing AWS account security by enabling MFA for IAM users, and updating the IAM user console password.
    - Recreated the Cruddur app conceptual design and Logical design using the lucid chart.
        - ![Conceptual Design](./week0-task-architecture-designs/Cruddur-Conceptual%20Design.png)
    -  Practiced using AWS CloudShell.
    - Installed AWS CLI and used my existing AWS credentials for configuration.
    - Created AWS budget from the AWS CLI
    - Created my AWS Billing alarm.
